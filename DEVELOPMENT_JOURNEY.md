## Initial Analysis and Planning

### Understanding the Requirements

When I first received the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for SnapConnect, I spent considerable time analyzing what was being asked. The project was ambitious - a two-phase development where Phase 1 required building a complete Snapchat clone, and Phase 2 would add RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities.

**Key Requirements Identified:**
- Ephemeral messaging with custom timers
- Camera integration with AR filters
- Stories functionality (24-hour visibility)
- Friend management system
- Real-time messaging
- User authentication
- QR code "ShopTag" system
- Woodworking-focused niche targeting

**My Initial Thinking Process:**
1. **Scope Management**: I realized this was a massive undertaking. I needed to focus on Phase 1 first and build a solid foundation.
2. **Feature Prioritization**: I identified the core features that would make this feel like Snapchat: camera, ephemeral messaging, stories, and friend management.
3. **Technical Feasibility**: I considered what could realistically be built with the given tech stack (React Native, Expo, Supabase).
4. **User Experience**: I thought about how to make the app intuitive for users familiar with Snapchat while adding the woodworking niche elements.

### Strategic Decisions Made Early

**Decision 1: Start with Mock Data**
I decided to build the entire frontend with mock data first, then integrate with Supabase later. This would allow rapid prototyping and ensure the UI/UX was solid before dealing with backend complexity.

**Decision 2: Focus on Mobile-First Design**
Since this is a Snapchat clone, mobile experience was paramount. I would ensure everything worked perfectly on mobile, with web compatibility as a secondary concern.

**Decision 3: Component-Driven Architecture**
I planned to build reusable components that could be easily styled and maintained, following modern React Native best practices.

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack Rationale

**React Native with Expo:**
- **Why**: Expo provides excellent camera APIs, easy deployment, and cross-platform compatibility
- **Considerations**: Some limitations with native modules, but the benefits outweighed the constraints
- **Alternative Considered**: Bare React Native, but Expo's managed workflow was more suitable for rapid development

**Zustand for State Management:**
- **Why**: Lightweight, TypeScript-friendly, and perfect for the app's complexity level
- **Considerations**: Redux was overkill; Context API would be too verbose
- **Benefits**: Easy to persist auth state, simple to understand and maintain

**Expo Router for Navigation:**
- **Why**: File-based routing similar to Next.js, which I'm familiar with
- **Benefits**: Automatic deep linking, type-safe navigation, modern approach
- **Learning Curve**: Had to understand the differences from React Navigation

**NativeWind for Styling:**
- **Initial Plan**: Use NativeWind for Tailwind-like styling
- **Reality Check**: Realized it might conflict with certain Expo components
- **Final Decision**: Switched to React Native StyleSheet for better compatibility and control

### Architecture Patterns Chosen

**Feature-Based Folder Structure:**
```
app/
  (tabs)/          # Tab-based routes
  auth/            # Authentication screens
  chat/            # Chat functionality
  story/           # Story viewing
components/
  ui/              # Reusable UI components
  chat/            # Chat-specific components
  camera/          # Camera-specific components
  story/           # Story-specific components
store/             # Zustand stores
constants/         # App constants and mock data
utils/             # Utility functions
types/             # TypeScript type definitions
```

**State Management Pattern:**
- Separate stores for different domains (auth, chat, story, friends)
- Persistent storage only for essential data (auth state)
- Mock data integration for rapid development

---

## Project Setup and Foundation

### Initial Project Creation

**Step 1: Project Initialization**
I started with a fresh Expo project, ensuring I had the latest version for the best API support.

**Step 2: Dependencies Planning**
I carefully selected dependencies to avoid conflicts:
- `expo-camera` for camera functionality
- `expo-image` for optimized image handling
- `expo-linear-gradient` for visual effects
- `lucide-react-native` for consistent icons
- `zustand` for state management
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for persistence

**Step 3: TypeScript Configuration**
I set up strict TypeScript configuration to catch errors early and ensure code quality.

### Color Scheme and Design System

**Design Philosophy:**
I wanted to create a design that felt modern and professional while being distinct from Snapchat's bright yellow branding.

**Color Palette Decision Process:**
1. **Primary Color**: Chose `#8B5A2B` (warm brown) to reflect the woodworking theme
2. **Secondary Color**: Selected `#7D8C75` (sage green) for natural, earthy feel
3. **Background**: Used `#F8F7F4` (warm off-white) for a premium, crafted feel
4. **Text Colors**: Carefully balanced contrast ratios for accessibility

**Why These Colors:**
- Brown represents wood and craftsmanship
- Green represents nature and growth
- The palette feels professional yet approachable
- Good contrast ratios for readability
- Distinct from other social media apps

## Authentication System Implementation

### Planning the Auth Flow

**User Journey Mapping:**
1. App launch → Check if user is authenticated
2. If not authenticated → Show login screen
3. Login/Signup → Validate credentials → Navigate to main app
4. Logout → Clear state → Return to login

**State Management for Auth:**
I decided to use Zustand with persistence to maintain login state across app restarts.

### Implementation Details

**AuthStore Design:**
```typescript
type AuthState = {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  userId: string | null;
  username: string | null;
  displayName: string | null;
  avatar: string | null;
  login: (userId: string, username: string, displayName: string, avatar: string) => void;
  logout: () => void;
};
```

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Persistent Storage**: Used AsyncStorage to remember login state
2. **Mock Authentication**: For development, created a simple username/password system using mock data
3. **User Data Storage**: Stored essential user info in the auth state for easy access throughout the app

**Login Screen Design:**
- Clean, minimal interface
- Woodworking-themed imagery
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Helpful hint for testing ("Try username 'woodmaster'")

**Signup Flow:**
- Simple form with display name, username, and password
- Immediate login after successful signup
- Error handling for validation

### Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: Route Protection**
- **Problem**: Needed to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing main app
- **Solution**: Created a root index.tsx that redirects based on auth state

**Challenge 2: Loading States**
- **Problem**: AsyncStorage is asynchronous, causing flash of wrong screen
- **Solution**: Added loading state to prevent premature redirects

---

## Navigation Structure Design

### Tab Navigation Planning

**Tab Structure Decision:**
I chose a four-tab layout similar to Snapchat but adapted for the woodworking community:

1. **Chats** (MessageSquare icon): Main communication hub
2. **Camera** (Camera icon): Content creation center
3. **Stories** (Users icon): Community content discovery
4. **Profile** (User icon): Personal settings and info

**Why This Structure:**
- Familiar to Snapchat users
- Logical flow from consumption (chats/stories) to creation (camera) to management (profile)
- Easy thumb navigation on mobile devices

### Expo Router Implementation

**File Structure:**
```
app/
  _layout.tsx          # Root layout with Stack navigator
  index.tsx            # Auth redirect logic
  (tabs)/
    _layout.tsx        # Tab navigator configuration
    index.tsx          # Chats screen (default tab)
    camera.tsx         # Camera screen
    stories.tsx        # Stories feed
    profile.tsx        # User profile
  auth/
    login.tsx          # Login screen
    signup.tsx         # Signup screen
  chat/
    [id].tsx          # Individual chat screen
  story/
    [id].tsx          # Story viewer
```

**Navigation Configuration:**
- Stack navigator at root level for auth and modal screens
- Tab navigator for main app functionality
- Dynamic routes for chats and stories
- Proper header configuration for each screen

### Header and Navigation Styling

**Design Decisions:**
- Clean, minimal headers
- Consistent color scheme
- No unnecessary shadows or borders
- Context-appropriate titles and actions

---

## Core UI Components Development

### Component Architecture Philosophy

**Reusability First:**
I designed components to be highly reusable with prop-based customization rather than creating one-off components.

**TypeScript Integration:**
Every component was built with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety and better developer experience.

### Avatar Component

**Design Thinking:**
The Avatar component needed to handle multiple use cases:
- Basic profile pictures
- Online status indicators
- Story rings (gradient borders)
- Various sizes

**Implementation Features:**
- Expo Image for optimized loading
- Configurable size and styling
- Online badge positioning
- Border support for story rings

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
interface AvatarProps {
  source: string;
  size?: number;
  style?: ViewStyle;
  showBorder?: boolean;
  showOnlineBadge?: boolean;
  isOnline?: boolean;
}
```

### StoryRing Component

**Complex Visual Requirements:**
Stories needed Instagram-style gradient rings to indicate unviewed content.

**Implementation Challenges:**
1. **Gradient Rings**: Used LinearGradient with careful positioning
2. **Viewed State**: Different colors for viewed vs unviewed stories
3. **Nested Components**: Avatar inside gradient ring with proper spacing

**Visual Design:**
- Vibrant gradient for unviewed stories
- Muted gray for viewed stories
- Proper spacing and sizing ratios

### Button Component

**Comprehensive Button System:**
Created a flexible button component supporting multiple variants and states.

**Variants Implemented:**
- Primary: Main action buttons
- Secondary: Alternative actions
- Outline: Subtle actions
- Text: Minimal actions

**States Handled:**
- Loading with spinner
- Disabled state
- Different sizes (small, medium, large)
- Full width option

### Design System Consistency

**Spacing System:**
- Consistent padding and margins
- 8px base unit for spacing
- Logical spacing relationships

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- Clear font weight distinctions
- Appropriate font sizes for mobile
- Good contrast ratios

**Color Usage:**
- Semantic color naming
- Consistent application across components
- Accessibility considerations

---

## State Management Architecture

### Zustand Store Design Philosophy

**Domain-Driven Stores:**
I separated concerns into different stores rather than one monolithic store:

1. **AuthStore**: User authentication and profile data
2. **ChatStore**: Messages, conversations, and chat state
3. **StoryStore**: Story content and viewing state
4. **FriendStore**: Friend relationships and user discovery

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Better performance (components only subscribe to relevant data)
- Easier testing and reasoning about state changes

### AuthStore Implementation

**Persistence Strategy:**
```typescript
export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      // state and actions
    }),
    {
      name: 'auth-storage',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => AsyncStorage),
    }
  )
);
```

**Why Persistence Here:**
- Users expect to stay logged in
- Critical for user experience
- Small data footprint

### ChatStore Architecture

**Complex State Management:**
The chat store needed to handle:
- Multiple conversations
- Message history per chat
- Unread counts
- Real-time updates (simulated)
- Message states (read, expired, replayed)

**Data Structure Design:**
```typescript
type ChatState = {
  chats: Chat[];
  messages: Record<string, Message[]>;
  currentChatId: string | null;
  // ... methods
};
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Messages by Chat ID**: Used Record<string, Message[]> for O(1) lookup
2. **Current Chat Tracking**: Maintained active chat for proper state management
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediately updated UI, then handled backend sync

### StoryStore Complexity

**Story Viewing State:**
Stories required complex state management:
- Current story being viewed
- Current item within story
- Progress tracking
- View status updates

**Multi-User Story Management:**
- Stories from multiple users
- User data integration
- Filtering (my stories vs friends' stories)
- Temporal sorting (most recent first)

### Mock Data Integration

**Development Strategy:**
I created comprehensive mock data to simulate a realistic app experience:

**Mock Users:**
- Diverse set of woodworking personas
- Realistic names and avatars
- Online status simulation

**Mock Conversations:**
- Various message types (text, image, video)
- Different timestamps for realistic ordering
- Unread count simulation

**Mock Stories:**
- Woodworking-themed content
- Multiple story items per user
- Realistic captions and timestamps

---

## Chat System Implementation

### Chat List Design

**Information Architecture:**
Each chat item needed to display:
- User avatar with online status
- Display name and username
- Last message preview
- Timestamp
- Unread count badge
- Message type indicator (camera icon for media)

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Avatar draws attention first
- Name is prominent
- Message preview is secondary
- Timestamp and badges are subtle but noticeable

### Individual Chat Screen

**Message Bubble Design:**
I implemented a Snapchat-like message interface:
- Different styles for sent vs received messages
- Media message placeholders
- Expired message indicators
- Timestamp display

**Input Interface:**
- Camera button for quick media capture
- Text input with multi-line support
- Send button with disabled state
- Keyboard handling for mobile

**Message Types:**
1. **Text Messages**: Standard chat bubbles
2. **Media Messages**: Special indicators with "tap to view"
3. **Expired Messages**: Grayed out with "Snap expired" text

### Real-time Simulation

**State Updates:**
Since this was built with mock data, I simulated real-time behavior:
- Immediate message sending
- Automatic read status updates
- Unread count management

**Future Backend Integration:**
Designed the state structure to easily integrate with Supabase real-time subscriptions later.
