Based on the video tutorial, here is a sequential outline of how the video features (including pictures) were implemented:

1.  **Initial Setup and Dependencies**:
    -   **Project Creation**: An Expo app was initialized using yarn create expo app (e.g., SnapchatCamera).
    -   **Core Libraries**: Key dependencies installed were:
        -   expo-camera: For accessing camera functionalities (taking pictures, recording videos).
        -   expo-media-library: For accessing and saving media to the device's photo library.
        -   expo-image & expo-video: For displaying images and playing videos within the app.
        -   expo-sharing: For sharing captured media to other apps.
    -   **Configuration**: app.json was updated to include Android permissions (e.g., WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, CAMERA, RECORD_AUDIO) and iOS plugins (expo-media-library, expo-camera) with custom permission messages.
    -   **Camera Component**: The core camera interface was built using CameraView from expo-camera.
    -   **Camera Reference (cameraRef)**: A useRef hook was used to create cameraRef, allowing access to CameraView methods like takePictureAsync() and recordAsync().
    -   **Camera Mode State**: A cameraMode state variable ('picture' or 'video') was introduced using useState to toggle between photo and video capture modes.
2.  **Taking Pictures**:
    -   **handleTakePicture Function**: An asynchronous function was created.
    -   **Capture Logic**: Inside handleTakePicture, cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync() was called. This method captures a still image.
    -   **Displaying Preview**: The URI of the captured picture (returned from takePictureAsync()) was stored in a picture state variable.
    -   **PictureView Component**: When the picture state contains a URI, a dedicated PictureView component is rendered instead of the CameraView. This component uses ExpoImage to display the picture.URI full screen.
3.  **Recording Videos**:
    -   **toggleRecord Function**: An asynchronous function was implemented to start and stop video recording.
    -   **Recording State (isRecording)**: An isRecording boolean state variable was used to track if a video is currently being recorded.
    -   **Start Recording**: If isRecording is false, isRecording is set to true, and cameraRef.current.recordAsync() is called to begin recording.
    -   **Stop Recording**: If isRecording is true, cameraRef.current.stopRecording() is called, and isRecording is set to false.
    -   **Displaying Preview**: The URI of the recorded video (returned from recordAsync()) was stored in a video state variable.
    -   **VideoViewComponent**: When the video state contains a URI, a VideoViewComponent is rendered instead of the CameraView. This component utilizes ExpoVideo's VideoView and the useVideoPlayer hook to play the video.URI, providing options like looping, muting, and autoplay. Native controls for playback (seek bar, fullscreen, speed) are enabled by default.
4.  **Media Actions within Preview (Saving, Sharing, Disappearing)**:
    -   **PictureView and VideoViewComponent Controls**: Both preview components include a set of buttons:
        -   **Save to Library**:
            -   An icon button (e.g., down arrow) is pressed.
            -   The MediaLibrary.saveToLibraryAsync() function (from expo-media-library) is called with the URI of the current picture or video.
            -   An Alert confirms "Picture saved" or "Video saved."
        -   **Share**:
            -   A share icon button is pressed.
            -   The Sharing.shareAsync() function (from expo-sharing) is called with the URI of the current media.
            -   This opens the device's native share sheet, allowing the user to send the media via various apps (Messages, WhatsApp, etc.).
        -   **Close/Discard (Making Disappear from Preview)**:
            -   An "X" (close) icon button is present in the top-left of the preview screen.
            -   When pressed, it sets the picture or video state variable back to null or an empty string.
            -   This action causes the PictureView or VideoViewComponent to unmount from the UI, returning the user to the live camera view.
            -   _Important Note_: This mechanism makes the media "disappear" from the app's _preview screen_. The captured media is initially in the app's cache and is permanently "deleted" from the app's _viewing pipeline_ if not explicitly saved to the device's photo library. This is not a Snapchat-like message that disappears after a single view by a recipient.
5.  **Captioning**:
    -   The provided video tutorial **does not implement functionality for adding dynamic text captions or overlays directly to the captured pictures or videos**. The text elements seen in the demo are static UI labels or part of the app's navigation (e.g., "Snap," "Video," "QR Code Detected").
